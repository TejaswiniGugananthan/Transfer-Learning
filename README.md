# Implementation-of-Transfer-Learning
## Aim
To Implement Transfer Learning for classification using VGG-19 architecture.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Develop an image classification model using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG19 model.

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1:
Import required libraries, load the dataset, and define training & testing datasets.

### STEP 2:
Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer. Use CrossEntropyLoss for multi-class classification and Adam optimizer for efficient training.

### STEP 3:
Train the model using the training dataset with forward and backward propagation.

### STEP 4:
Evaluate the model on the testing dataset to measure accuracy and performance.

### STEP 5:
Make predictions on new data using the trained model.

## PROGRAM

```python
# Load Pretrained Model and Modify for Transfer Learning



# Modify the final fully connected layer to match the dataset classes



# Include the Loss function and optimizer




# Train the model



```
